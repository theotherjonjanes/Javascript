Rick lands the vehicle on Morty's demand and passes out. The bomb activates by itself and seems to be left unchecked, but ultimately it is shown that life on Earth remains intact. After having breakfast with their family, Rick takes Morty to another dimension to collect seeds of \"Mega Trees\", which Morty agrees to hide in his own rectum to get past intergalactic customs. However, Rick and Morty's cover is blown and they escape while engaging in a shootout with alien insects. Ultimately, the seeds briefly cause Morty to be highly intelligent, despite the fact that he missed a semester of school because he's been in adventures with Rick. This causes his parents to believe he is fine with his education, but this wastes the seeds, so Rick informs Morty that they need to go back and get more, while their aftereffects leave Morty writhing on the floor.",

They become annoyed that the President calls on them like \"Ghostbusters\" without any gratitude, so they go back home to play Minecraft. The President then calls Rick on the phone, and they get into an argument about who exactly works for who: Rick says that he doesn't \"work\" for the President, he saves the world from alien dangers because he feels like it, but the President counters that the multiple times Rick has saved the world are the only reason he hasn't been arrested long ago for possessing incredibly dangerous advanced technologies. Their argument escalates to Rick claiming the U.S. government couldn't take him down even if it tried, leading to a battle of egos. Rick one-ups the President by not only evading his security forces, but solving the Arab-Israeli conflict behind his back. This culminates in a running battle in the White House between Rick and the President's security forces.\n Meanwhile, continuing from the preceding episode, Beth has newfound happiness that she chose to stay with her family instead of leaving and having a clone take her place. Summer enjoys a shopping trip with her so much that she says it's like her mother is a different person - causing Beth to start worrying that she actually is a clone made by Rick, simply programmed to think she chose to stay. When she calls Rick and asks if she's a clone he says she isn't, though she realizes he'd say the same thing if she was a clone to keep her from knowing the truth. She falsely claims she's certain she isn't a clone, but Rick in turn points out that she's lying, knowing that if she is a clone, he would terminate her for becoming self-aware - which causes her to panic and flee. Eventually Beth rushes to Jerry's apartment and pleads with him to help prove she's real. They kiss and he's convinced she's real, and she realizes how lucky she is to have someone love her even if he is as dumb and ordinary as Jerry. The entire family reunites to hide from Rick in a shack in the woods, but he tracks them down. Beth thinks he's come to kill her for being a clone, but she doesn't care because it means she's a reject like the rest of her family and they love each other. Rick again insists that she is not a clone - he actually came to kill Jerry so Beth would come back. Beth confronts Rick that she won't leave Jerry again, and challenges that if Rick doesn't agree he can just flee to another parallel universe again. Rick cannot bring himself to leave because he's become emotionally attached to his family, so he submits. Jerry moves back in to their house, and Rick agrees to respect him more.",
