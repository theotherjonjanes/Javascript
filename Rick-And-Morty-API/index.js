Rick lands the vehicle on Morty's demand and passes out. The bomb activates by itself and seems to be left unchecked, but ultimately it is shown that life on Earth remains intact. After having breakfast with their family, Rick takes Morty to another dimension to collect seeds of \"Mega Trees\", which Morty agrees to hide in his own rectum to get past intergalactic customs. However, Rick and Morty's cover is blown and they escape while engaging in a shootout with alien insects. Ultimately, the seeds briefly cause Morty to be highly intelligent, despite the fact that he missed a semester of school because he's been in adventures with Rick. This causes his parents to believe he is fine with his education, but this wastes the seeds, so Rick informs Morty that they need to go back and get more, while their aftereffects leave Morty writhing on the floor.",

                        summary: "Rick and Morty visit another planet and witness \"The Festival\", an annual event where the local populace commits crimes for one night without consequence. Rick compares it to The Purge movies. Morty forces Rick to rescue Arthricia, a young alien girl. She betrays them and steals Rick's gun and spaceship, leaving Rick and Morty to fend for themselves. Rick calls Summer and has her send advanced power armor suits for Rick and Morty's protection. Morty goes on a killing rampage until Rick knocks him out. Rick allows Arthricia to use Morty's suit and helps her to kill the corrupt nobility who implemented the Festival in the first place. The planet's inhabitants decide to create a new society from the ground up, however, rioting breaks out over disagreements about it. One of them suggests keeping the Festival. Morty feels guilty over all the aliens he's killed, but Rick wrongly blames a candy bar that Morty has eaten, thus appeasing him.",

                        summary: "Rick and his family attend the wedding of Birdperson and Tammy, whose guest list includes seventeen of the Federation's most wanted — including Rick and Birdperson himself. At the wedding reception, Tammy reveals herself to be a Federation agent and seemingly kills Birdperson. Numerous agents invade the building, starting a battle against the guests. Rick gets his family out of the wedding safely, but they are unable to return home as the Federation would be looking for them there, so Rick and his family decides to live on a very small Earth-like planet. Rick overhears Jerry proposing to turn Rick in and return to Earth, then Rick allows himself to be arrested. His family returns to Earth, which has joined the Federation and is crowded by alien tourists. Jerry is assigned a job by the Federation.",
